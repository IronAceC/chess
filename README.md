# chess
Simple C# program to make a chess board

I haven't really worked on formatting or organizing anything, so it all looks really bad. Just go to main and then runrun(I'm not good at naming anything either) to see the main part of code that I've written. 
The pieces folder is mostly empty, I'm still working on that part.
